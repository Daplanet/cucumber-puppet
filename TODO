0.1.0:
- does a feature fail, when specified requires are not found? (manitest)
- README: more about the idea behind it and some capabilities
- let cucumber-puppet{,-gen} find the repository's base dir automatically,
  so that it works from any directory in the tree
  - add some Rakefile magic like cucumber (lib) for running all features
- move features to modules? or both? (for simpler packaging of modules)

0.2.0:
- support for hostname-based features (currently only class-based)
