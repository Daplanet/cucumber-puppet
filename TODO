- README: more about the idea behind it and some capabilities
- let cucumber-puppet{,-gen} find the repositories base dir automatically,
  so that it works from any directory in the tree
- write some tests
  - generate world
  - generate a feature according to template
  - error handling:
    - no argument
    - non-existing feature
    - feature-file
    - feature-dir
- move features to modules? or both?
- does a feature fail, when specified requires are not found? (manitest)
- add some Rakefile magic like cucumber
- support for hostname-based features (currently only class-based)
